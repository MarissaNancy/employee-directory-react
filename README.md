## Description
For this homework assignment we will be creating an employee directory with React. In doing this we will help a employee or manager so that they can view non-sensitive data about other employees. We will be filtering employees by name so that employee information is easily attainable. 

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view the entire employee directory at once so that I can have quick access to their information.

## Tools and Technologies
- React
- Random User API
- GET Request


## Acceptance Criteria

- Given when the user can sort employee table by at least one category
- Given when the user can filter employee list by at least one property.
